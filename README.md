## Introduction

Basic object avoidance game.  Player is controlled with mouse movement within the window, in which the player can traverse left or right.  Once the game is started, objects will begin to fall from top to bottom of canvas/playing area.  The one of three objects will be generated randomly.

Each of the three objects have a specific purpose to either: 

- Gain points
- Reduce health points (you being with 3)
- Gain health points (add health/"lives" back to your player)...*will also award some "normal points*

Upon taking hits from the objects you want to avoid... if this has reduced your player health to zero, the game is then over. 

The falling objects include a slight gravity, in addition to a randomly applied velocity.  Should the object collide with the left or right edge of the canvas/playing area. The object will reverse coarse remaining play (bounce off left or right border).
